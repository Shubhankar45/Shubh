This is a placeholder for the PDF resume file. In a real implementation, this would be an actual PDF file containing Shubhankar Patel's detailed resume with sections for:

1. Contact Information
2. Professional Summary
3. Education (B.Tech CSE, ITER Bhubaneswar 2021-2025)
4. Technical Skills (Python, Flask, Data Science, etc.)
5. Projects (AI Budget Planner, Real-Time Tracker, FIFA Analysis)
6. Certifications (Microsoft Data Scientist, AWS, etc.)
7. Experience and Achievements
8. Languages and Additional Information

The file should be replaced with an actual PDF document for production use.
